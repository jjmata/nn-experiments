# nn-experiments

If you want to learn about deep learning I highly recommend the excellent [WildML](http://www.wildml.com/) series written by Denny Britz.

The notebooks in this project are variations on his '[Implementing a Neural Network from Scratch in Python](http://www.wildml.com/2015/09/implementing-a-neural-network-from-scratch/)' exploring expressing the same using [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), [Keras](http://keras.io/), and [skflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/skflow).

**Note:** I'm new to these frameworks, so there maybe better and more correct ways to express this than I came up with.

## setup

**Note:** You will have to update *requirements.txt* and change the tensorflow dependency if you install on something else then Mac OS X, [see here](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.7/get_started/os_setup.html#pip-installation). 

```bash
# Create a new virtual environment
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
# Install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Start the notebook server
KERAS_BACKEND=tensorflow jupyter notebook
```
